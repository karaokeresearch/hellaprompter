The Karaoke Research Council presents... (ding!)

Saturday, April 23, 2016
Live from Studio A at Portland Community Media
It's Presentation Nation!
Tonight's show:
A presentation by David Garrett
Musical guest Volcanic Pinnacles
And your host ROSS BRACKETT!

(Ross runs out)

Haha all right!
Welcome, one and all to the premiere episode of the Karaoke Research Council's brand new show, Presentation Nation. I am your host, Ross Brackett. 

We've been spending the last few months scouring Portland's meetup scene to find you the best presentations you may have missed! From Javascript to jam-making, Budget reports to beat making, the automation tool Puppet to sock puppet construction... every month, Portlanders labor for thousands of hours to make fantastic, information-packed presentations that only get shown to a select few peers before being tossed to the wind. Well, no longer! Your presentations are cool, Portland, and it's time we documented them. 

It is indeed the mission of Presentation Nation to document this underground, under-appreciated artform one presentation at a time. Combine that with some of the wildest bands around - Volcanic Pinnacles is our musical guest today- and you've got the makings of an engrossing half-hour of television, which is what we hope to bring you tonight!

And on that note, Let's jump right in with our first presentation... ever! I saw this presentation for the first time about a month ago and thought it was awesome, so I invited him here tonight, and he said yes, ladies and gentlemen, David Garrett!

Now, David, what will you be presenting on tonight?
(he says)
OK, and are you ready?
(yes, or stall)

OK, then I'll leave you to it. One more round of applause for David Garrett!

All right, if you're just tuning in, this is Presentation Nation, I'm your host Ross Brackett. I am so pleased now to announce our musical guest. You can find them online at https://volcanicpinnacles.bandcamp.com/, (and any upcoming shows) - two very nice individuals who are also capable of generating unfathomable consciousness-bending sounds in real time, ladies and gentlemen, Volcanic Pinnacles!

Volcanic Pinnacles, ladies and gentlemen! (Shake hands)

All right, if you're just tuning in, this is Presentation Nation, I'm your host Ross Brackett.

For our final presentation of the evening, I'll be giving a little presentation of my own, and perhaps a little walk down memory lane for those of you have been doing this for a while. I call it:

PowerPoint: Origins



PowerPoint
Most commonly-used presentation software
Originally called Presenter
Created by Forethought, Incorporated
PowerPoint
Designed for the original Apple Macintosh
Renamed from Presenter to PowerPoint in 1987
Forethought Inc. purchased by Microsoft the same year

So, if you haven't already guessed why the graphics on this edition of Presentation Nation are so old school, the reason is this: we're using PowerPoint to do all the titles for this episode! In fact, you're looking at a PowerPoint 1.0 slideshow right now, running on a virtual Macintosh on my laptop right now. 

So, let's do a basic tour of what PowerPoint 1.0's capable of and then we'll show you how to install it on your own system. 

PowerPoint
Importing graphics
Importing assets from your PC
How to get your own copy and set up your own virtual Mac to run it
Or if you just want to play around with MacOS, show the address:


Well, I hope you enjoyed this episode of Presentation Nation
